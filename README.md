universal search desktop experiments in addon format

Installation / how to hack on this?
- you have to put a proxy file inside your local FF extensions directory, pointing to the absolute path to this code.
  See MDN for more: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Setting_up_extension_development_environment#Firefox_extension_proxy_file
- TBD: does the proxy file detect changes in the addon source code? not sure yet.
